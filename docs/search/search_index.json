Nefertiti statue 3D model Afgietsel van de buste van Nefertiti - Download Free 3D model by The National Museum of Antiquities (@rmo_leiden) [d148f77] - Sketchfab Dit is een kopie van de beroemde buste van de Egyptische koningin Nefertiti, echtgenote van koning Achnaton (ca. 1353-1336 v. Chr.). In 1912 werd de sculptuur in de Egyptische stad Amarna opgegraven. De sculptuur wordt vaak een buste genoemd, naar een typisch Westerse vorm van portretuur waarbij alleen hoofd en schouders zijn gebeeldhouwd. Oud-Egyptische beeldhouwers maakten daarentegen in de regel enkel beelden van het volledige lichaam van een persoon. De buste van Nefertiti was dan ook niet bedoeld om tentoongesteld te worden. Het is een voorstudie voor beeldhouwers, die op basis van dit model offici\u00eble, volledige sculpturen van de koningin konden maken. -  - Details - Inventarisnummer: F 1954/3.3 - Afdeling: Egypte en Nubi\u00eb - Vindplaats: Egypte - Materiaal: gips - Afmetingen: hoogte 48 cm - Periode: 20ste eeuw - Verwerving: legaat 1954 maart -  - https://hdl.handle.net/21.12126/22511 - Afgietsel van de buste van Nefertiti - Download Free 3D model by The National Museum of Antiquities (@rmo_leiden)"},{"location":"2023/Late%20Night%20Linux%20%E2%80%93%20Episode%20215/","title":"Late Night Linux \u2013 Episode 215","text":"<p>Episode Link: https://latenightlinux.com/late-night-linux-episode-215/</p> <p>Release Date: 06/02/2023</p>"},{"location":"2023/Late%20Night%20Linux%20%E2%80%93%20Episode%20215/#discoveries","title":"Discoveries","text":"Name and Link Page Title Page Description MuseScore 4 MuseScore 4 is OUT NOW!
