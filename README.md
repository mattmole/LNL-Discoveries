# LNL-Discoveries
Publishes a site detailing all discoveries from the Late Night Linux podcast

## Todo:

- [x] Strip any | characters from the <title> and <meta name="description" content=""> strings
- [x] Add header logo
- [ ] Instead of checking which files exist, write database with number of discoveries and checksum of details
- [ ] Query database to determine whether to process or not
- [x] Tidy and document code
- [ ] Search in <script> for <title> and <meta> information
- [ ] Generate using GitHub actions
- [x] Update CSS properly and don't use the JS override
- [x] Tweak the for loop range once discoveries tags have been found
