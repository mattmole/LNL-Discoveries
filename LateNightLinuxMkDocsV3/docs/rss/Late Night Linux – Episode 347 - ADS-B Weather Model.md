# ADS-B Weather Model

Page Title: Weather Model based on ADS-B - Niklas Oberhuber

Page Description: Each second thousands of planes send messages about their location and flight data - in ADS-B messages. These are intended to prevent mid-air collisions, but we can exploit the aggregated data to map out atmospheric conditions. By deriving the wind speed from the broadcast flight data, we can model wind speed and direction.
