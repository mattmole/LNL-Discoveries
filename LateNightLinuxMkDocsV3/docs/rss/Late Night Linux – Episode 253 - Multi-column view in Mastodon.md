# Multi-column view in Mastodon

Page Title: Graham Morrison: "As a long-time Tweetdeck user (no more), Mastodon…" - Fosstodon

Page Description: Attached: 1 image -  - As a long-time Tweetdeck user (no more), Mastodon's _Advanced Web Interface_ column implementation is seriously impressive; cleaner, and more responsive. It's a little tricky to discover and add-to, but the output looks great. Big thanks to the team behind this.
